Bullet electronic speed trap
by
Laabicz

This project deals with the measurement of the speed of the projectile at the muzzle. It uses a precise chronograph built on a platform AVR (MCU ATTiny2313 at 20MHz), own design optical gates and multiplatform software for computer processing.
It is still in development so some parts may not be available or fully functional
